A few months ago, right in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak, [Damien Tassone](http://localhost:9000/public/images/m16.jpg) joined MUI. He's the first full-time member to focus on enterprise components. Back then, we only made a quick mention of it. It's never too late to introduce him properly.

Prior to joining MUI, Damien worked in the finance industry in London for a decade. Part of the initial Agile Market team at RBS, and more recently leading a large Commodity Trading application at Adaptive, Damien has developed his React experience as part of large projects where Components driven design plays a huge role in successfully delivering applications. He loves TypeScript.

Right from the start, Damien has made fast and significant progress. He has been an amazing addition to the team, and thanks to him, we are on the verge of releasing a new advanced component: the [Data Grid](http://localhost:9000/public/images/m16.jpg).

The enterprise team will continue developing the data grid component, and progressively extend to new advanced components as we grow the team. Here's a quick view of [the enterprise roadmap](http://localhost:9000/public/images/m16.jpg).
